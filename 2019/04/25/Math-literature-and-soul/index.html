        <p>（更新：现在回过头来看你，我在说的其实就是反对那些只会说一堆抽象话的抽象式教学）</p>
<p>－－－－</p>
<p>For “spirit/soul” I guess I’m not using the most exact words, pardon to my poor vocabulary. I cannot think of what the Chinese word “精神” should be translated into, according to my understanding to which. Soul seems like “灵魂”, you died and the thing went up heaven or hell; spirit is actually the most accurate word for “精神” BUT I always doubt that. My understanding to spirit and “精神” differs from the fact that spirit can refer to those tiny little non-creatures living in the jungle whispering night songs. “精神” however does definitely not have this meaning. “精神” is perhaps the most appropiate thing for me to use, soul seems more artistic; but eventually I’ve choosen the later, less biased nevertheless.</p>
<p>Just a disclaimer; let’s move some steps to the point. “Soul” is one thing that I care much for, as knowledge lower than soul under my understanding. For knowledge it seems that you only need to remember and use it(tools for mind); for soul however you want to extract the feelings from some books, words, etc. And I believe mathematics has an way to take an magical mirror and communicate with the invisibles.</p>
<p>In short: mathematics has feelings for people to understand, which is different from rigorous sentences only allowed for emotionless reasoning.</p>
<p>For example, platonicism can be seem as an ultimate optimism to “truth”, and formalism seems more conservative. Bishop has criticized over formalism, and we can also read out emotions from it. Bishop admire mathematical intuition(数感) and feeling that set theory is developing “useless exact”. I’m of course still too weak to form ideas and criticism over it, but since you “love/cherish” something, “hate” something, there are spaces to discuss about their feelings. Hilbert yelled out “No one can expel us from the attic created by Cantor!” and Godel suddenly made a heavy strike, and I believe that anyone reading any mathematical history will see the obvious feelings between every axiom every claim every conjecture and somehow being beaten/encouraged by the weird cruel reality. You argue for one topic, or another one, you try to proof the positive, but eventually got the opposite - also interesting enough, your own point of view still have to be under the examination of far time and short ugly powerful rational - by the way I don’t know if Godel has feeling towards his imcompleteness theorem, let’s just say he’s just trying to make out a result.</p>
<p>Just in case, it is certainly too shallow if you just want to read feelings out and label them happy or sad. There may be delicate feelings, as if not all classical music are made out to express utter happiness - it is hard to say, you will be touched but you cannot describe if it is happy or sad. Human are lacking words to describe them, but the theorists “analyze” them and thought it is what they meant to mean. Same for mathematics, for reading out “feelings” from more than mathematical history.</p>
<p>So what’s the other ways to read out feelings? I have said about some feelings I read out from the Godel’s incompleteness theorem, mostly thanks to its history. But the theorems themselves, as well as the structure a system uses, could also be with “feelings”. Consider you want to describe “red, yellow, and blue” in math. You can just give them a set, a “3” actually. Inside the 3 are three different elements, but something becomes… strange here. To contruct 3, you firstly construct a 2; to construct 2, you also have to construct a 1, and 0 of course. We can say, “the construction of 1 is dependent to 0, and 2 to 1, and 3 to 2”. However it is trivially(really trivial!) obvious that red does not depend on yellow.</p>
<p>So you may have to think that, set theory is a tool, it has its characteristics - abstract some information away, and seemed not nice(actually the “nice” is rather personal), but it is anyway not the thing it wants to describe, just like I can say moon or “月亮” but both are not the real moon nevertheless. Let’s give the above boring example another try: how should we describe yellow, blue and red?</p>
<p>Programmers and type theorists may think of data structures or algebraic types. In Haskell it is just <code>data Color = Red | Yellow | Green</code>. But when come to reality, one may find out that though the colors not dependent, they are not completely “distinct”: they give you different fellings, but for example, they can render toghether. You definitely cannot continuing thinking some black magic over the type like “Red -&gt; Yellow :: Color -&gt; Color” to give the meaning of “rendering red and yellow toghether” so are their better chioce for defining the colors in a simple way, with the aim to “describe color” - rather than “abstract for the essence”?</p>
<p>The answer is still easy, but it must not be the best(open problem, without totally a best answer!). It’s just a tuple of 3, the well know RGB, and for the RGBA it fails to fall into my main consideration. Afterall, it is personal: what feelings you feel important and needed to be added, and what are(just like alpha - I’ll say “we are going to consider colors, not pictures”) not?</p>
<p>So from the above I have completely ignored some restriction on mathematics, and my advocation seems to be “understand, and find out what feelings one set of object can bring to you, and use the most precise - rather than most abstract or useful or powerful or so - tools for the feelings to express”.</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, and of course immature. I don’t even know I will use this crazy thinking in the future life, so let’s just consider it as an interesting point of view. I still have got more over “what feelings can you bring out from the math”.</p>
<p>I have learnt homotopy type theory in an actually very elemantary level, and when I first heard of HoTT, I’ve been attracted by the advocation from ice1000, that “HoTT is about unifying/transfering different theory altoghether!” so ignore the technical details of unification and transportation, what do they mean, and maybe, what we can learn just from the two words? And when reading the HoTT, I gradually read out the question of “how should we consider something to be equal” - as the others think “feelings and idea/theory” are different, I hardly want to accept it. For me, the “observation angle” here may be a subtle feeling expressed; it is obvious though, and it reflects how people(well, actually type theorists) want to think about “how do people understand equality”. I even wonder if even the most restricted sentence could have feelings, even if you are in the court and forced to speak well and “unbiased”. To the conclusion, anything any words have feelings.</p>
<p>And altoghether, feelings form the soul of the area of the mathematics. You appreciate it just like you appreciate how a people talk. It is optimistic to several kinds of problems, pessimistic or even “thinks certain kind of problem does not/ should never exist on the earth”. That’s a wonderful, poetic, perhaps balladic view of angle from all people’s discussion that has happened and persisted for thousand and thousands of years. There are no wars, but there is laugh and cry. But of course, the nuclear bombs. No one wants their theory applied and made this.</p>
<p>If you are sensitive enough you may find what I said “thinking just over the two words” a little strange. From here, we’re going more to the joyful viewing angle literatures. “What is unification?” you may ask, but a more popular version of the what-question may be “What is love?” And how do you learn the answer to the question?</p>
<p>And you want to read books, and it at the same time answers another question that is “How to read a book?” So you want to find love in a novel. The novel makes stories, perhaps a little discussion or reasoning into it; different people makes different point of view. If you cannot understand a word well, you hardly will read out contents from book, and vice versa… At now I want to(as I always did) talk about a roomate of mine from Inner Mogolia, what he can read out from the books are no more than incests and rumors…</p>
<p>Since I have mentioned novels, it is wildly accepted by people over the Japanese animes and Light Novels. Both of them are bad things in the past, and the better is even better putting into present. I especially dislike the girls’ charateristic in these novels/animes, where they have scheming(心机) in their heart, but in the reality there are more than that. But it seems that lots of people has fell into these stereotype. It isn’t how a healthy girl should be like and by the way I see few critism over this from the feminists. The same for R18 series, they almost all make narrow characteristic for boys and girls. Perhaps internet is actually restricting every people’s field of view…</p>
<p>And what I want to criticize over especially is “浮躁”, impetuous, or flippancy, which few people in my country have thought throughout about it. It is just like you litter on the street while complaining about how smelly the street to be. </p>
<p>For the positive side, I especially care on a word that is “灵性”. It is close to “talence”, but again, subtly different. To get an understanding of it, it is just like you’re seeing a young child, he seem to have little knowledge making him somehow clumzy, but nevertheless his eye is shinning, and as if have a strong power of his 6th sense… I think this is what make the world beautiful. But talking about this, few novels can satisfy my query, even if they have got a nobel prize - just because people don’t care about it and the novel doesn’t discuss/emphasize it.</p>
<p>Alright where we have been talked to…</p>
<p>From “what’s the soul of math” we have arrived to another question “how to read a book” - and for the purpose of giving out the feeling towards several words. I have the strong feeling that, it helps you understand math, and it is more “metaphysical” than just imaging some diagrams or graphs in your mind, doing calculuations(important nevertheless, but not for consideration here) and appreciate the beauty of some solution’s simplicity. How to feel, how to understand, must be a rich topic with creative, charming answers.</p>
